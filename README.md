This Simple-Notes fork always shows the checklist drag&drop icon instead of the checkmarks.
This allows for quick reordering in checklists.

The code changes were done by [@leafar-tb](https://github.com/leafar-tb) in 2021.
The maintainer seems to not like these changes, even with a toggle in the settings, therefore I will maintain this patch from now on.
You can expect me to rebase against upstream quickly after a new version is released.
I may also add debug apks to the releases on this fork if needed.
